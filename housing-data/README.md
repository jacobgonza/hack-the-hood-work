# About this data ...
 
The genshin community is all about finding the next meta and getting the best characters. so i've found a data set that shows Characters in genshin impact at a base level. meaning level 90 (max), base wepos and no artifacts(artifacts can boot most if not all stats for a character).
# why i'm interested ...
 
I have personally played genshin for a while now and love the game. i know who the community say the best character is but, no one talks who has the best starting stats and i wanted to see how some of the newer characters fair with some old ones and if the have truly been power creped
