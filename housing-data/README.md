# why i'm interested ...
 
I'm going on a trip to japan in the future and i'm planning my trip now. I want to know about inexpensive types of places. I want to go to the best places in each city. I want to save as much as possible in order to have money to spend there. I like the culture of Japan and how different it is to the USA. I want to see different places and see the environments and landscapes. I want to make a process to use when I go to other places.
